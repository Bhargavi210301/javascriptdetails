        <h2>Terms: “unary”, “binary”, “operand”</h2>
        <p>
            Before we move on, let’s grasp some common terminology.An operand – is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is 2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of “operands”.An operator is unary if it has a single operand.<br> For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:
        </p>

        <h2>Maths</h2>
        <p>
            The following math operations are supported:
            <ul>
                <li>Addition +,</li>
                <li>Subtraction -,</li>
                <li>Multiplication *,</li>
                <li>Division /,</li>
                <li>Remainder %,</li>
                <li>Exponentiation **.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The first four are straightforward, while % and ** need a few words about them.

            <h3>Remainder %</h3>
            <p>
                The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.<br>For instance:
            </p>
            <p>
                ex1: alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2<br>
                ex2: alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3<br>
                ex3: alert( 8 % 4 ); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4<br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Exponentiation **</h3>
            <p>
                The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b.In school maths, we write that as a^b.<br>For instance:
            </p>
            <p>
                ex1: alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2<br>
                ex2: alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3<br>
                ex3: alert( 8 % 4 ); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4<br>
            </p>
        </div>
