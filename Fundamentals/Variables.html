    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <article id="article2">
        <p>A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:
        </p>
        <h2>Three Types of Variable</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Var</li>
            <li>Let</li>
            <li>Const</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="diveven">
            <h3>1.Var</h3>
            <p>The var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly,different, “old-school” way.There are subtle differences between let and var, but they do not matter for us yet. We’ll cover them in detail in the chapter The old "var".</p>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>var message = 'Hello';</p>
            <p>var age=15;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divodd">
            <h3>2.Let</h3>
            <p>The let keyword in Javascript was introduced in 2015 with ES6. Just like var in Javascript, let keyword is also used for variable declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped and local variable.</p>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value</p>
            <p>let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';</p>
        </div>

        <div class="diveven">
            <h3>3.Const</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, const is a keyword used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned a new value. It is similar to let , but the value of a const variable cannot be changed once it has been declared.</p>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>const myBirthday = '21.03.2001';</p>
            <p>const COLOR_RED = "#F00";</p>
        </div>
